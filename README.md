A Sierpinski gasket plotter.

The zeroth-order gasket is defined to be an equilateral triangle of radius 1, centered at the origin.  To obtain the first-order gasket, divide the zeroth- order gasket into four equally sized equilateral triangles and remove the central one.  This process can be repeated for each of the remaining triangles to obtain higher-order gaskets.
